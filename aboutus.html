                    Cosmic Journeys is a true account of actual sessions that were conducted in the research laboratory of The Monroe Institute beginning nearly forty years ago. Material from many of these Explorer sessions became the foundation for the residential programs held at the Institute, including the world-renowned Gateway Voyage. The Monroe Institute was founded by Robert A. Monroe, author of Journeys Out of the Body, Far Journeys, and Ultimate Journey. The work of the Institute today is the result of the many people who collaborated with Bob during these formative years in the exploration of human consciousness. Many educators, psychologists, physicists, psychiatrists, engineers, and physicians were instrumental in the growth and support of the Institute. Rosalind McKnight is one of these early Explorers who volunteered time and curiosity of spirit to venturing, with Bob's guidance, into other, nonphysical dimensions.
